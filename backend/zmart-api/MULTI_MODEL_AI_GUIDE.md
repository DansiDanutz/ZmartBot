# Compare all models
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/multi-model-analysis/compare-models/ETH"
```

### Model Status
```bash
# Check model availability
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/multi-model-analysis/model-status"

# Get setup instructions
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/multi-model-analysis/local-models/install"
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Analyze with all available models
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/multi-model-analysis/analyze/ETH?use_all_models=true"

# System status
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/multi-model-analysis/status"
```

## Model Selection Strategy

The system automatically selects models based on this priority:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4 Mini** - For comprehensive reports
2. **DeepSeek-R1-Distill** - For reasoning and pattern analysis
3. **DeepSeek-Coder** - For structured data analysis
4. **Phi-4** - For quick analysis (if available)
5. **Phi-3** - For basic quick analysis

### When to Use Each Model

**OpenAI GPT-4 Mini:**
- Comprehensive trading reports
- Historical context integration
- Natural language explanations
- Multi-timeframe analysis

**DeepSeek-R1-Distill:**
- Complex pattern recognition
- Logical reasoning over market data
- Time-series analysis
- Risk assessment

**DeepSeek-Coder:**

- Structured data analysis
- Numeric pattern detection
- Code-like logic processing

**Phi-3/Phi-4:**
- Quick market insights
- Fast trading signals
- Real-time analysis
- Resource-constrained environments

## Performance Optimization

### For Best Performance:
1. **Use Local Models** for routine analysis to reduce latency
2. **Reserve OpenAI** for comprehensive reports
3. **Enable Model Comparison** for critical decisions
4. **Monitor System Resources** when running local models

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Local models not available**
   - Run `./setup_local_models.sh`
   - Check Ollama installation: `ollama --version`
   - Verify models: `ollama list`

2. **Out of memory errors**
   - Close other applications
   - Use smaller models (Phi-3 instead of DeepSeek)
   - Increase system swap space

3. **Slow performance**
   - Check CPU usage
   - Ensure sufficient RAM
   - Use SSD storage for models

4. **API errors**
   - Verify OpenAI API key
   - Check internet connection
   - Monitor API quotas

## Testing

## Cost Analysis

### OpenAI Costs (Approximate):
- GPT-4 Mini: $0.00015 per 1K input tokens
- Average analysis: ~2K tokens = $0.0003 per analysis
- 1000 analyses per month: ~$0.30

### Local Model Costs:
- One-time setup: Free
- Electricity: ~$0.01-0.05 per analysis
- Hardware: Existing system resources

### Recommendation:
Use local models for routine analysis (90% of requests) and OpenAI for comprehensive reports (10% of requests) to optimize costs.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Support for additional local models
- Model fine-tuning for trading data
