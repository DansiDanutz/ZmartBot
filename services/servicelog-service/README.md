## 📊 API Endpoints

### Service Management
```bash
# Register a service
POST /api/v1/services/register
{
  "service_name": "zmart-api",
  "service_type": "api", 
  "port": 8000,
  "criticality_level": "CORE",
  "health_endpoints": ["http://localhost:8000/health"]
}

# Health check
GET /health
```

### Log Ingestion
```bash
# Send logs for analysis
POST /api/v1/logs/ingest
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "service_name": "zmart-api",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-27T01:40:00.000Z",
      "level": "ERROR",
      "message": "Database connection failed",
      "context": {"error_code": "DB_CONN_001"},
      "metadata": {"version": "1.0.0"}
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advice Management
```bash
# Get prioritized advice
GET /api/v1/advice?limit=10

# Get dashboard summary
GET /api/v1/advice/dashboard

# Resolve advice
POST /api/v1/advice/{advice_id}/resolve
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start ServiceLog System
```bash
cd /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot/services/servicelog-service

# Start the system
python3 servicelog_service.py --config servicelog_config.yaml

# System will start on port 8750
# Logs: "🚀 ServiceLog starting on port 8750"
```

### 2. Test with Health Check
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8750/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "servicelog", 
  "agents": ["error", "performance"],
  "log_buffer_size": 0,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Run Client Demo
```bash
# Test complete functionality
python3 client_example.py

# Demo will:
# ✅ Register a demo service
# ✅ Send normal and error logs
# ✅ Trigger pattern detection
# ✅ Generate and resolve advice
# ✅ Show dashboard summary
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. **Service Registration**
Services register with ServiceLog providing:
- Service name, type, port, criticality level
- Health endpoints for monitoring
- Expected log patterns and alert contacts

### 2. **Log Ingestion**
Services send logs in structured format:
- Timestamp, level, message, context, metadata
- Logs are buffered and processed in batches
- Background processing analyzes patterns

### 3. **Pattern Detection**
Specialized LogAgents analyze logs:
- **ErrorLogAgent**: Detects error patterns and frequencies
- **PerformanceLogAgent**: Monitors response times and resources
- Pattern thresholds trigger advice generation

### 4. **Advice Generation**
When patterns are detected:
- Evidence is collected from matching logs
- Root cause analysis is performed
- Priority score is calculated (0-100)
- Actionable advice with steps is generated
- MDC documentation references are linked

### 5. **Priority Queue**
Advice is ranked by priority score:
- Severity impact (0-40 points)
- Service criticality (0-30 points) 
- Frequency multiplier (1-3x)
- Confidence level (0.5-1.0x)

## 💡 Example Advice Generation

When 5+ database connection errors are detected:

```yaml
Title: "Database Connection Pool Exhaustion"
Severity: HIGH
Priority Score: 87.5
Evidence: 5 error logs with "connection failed" pattern
Resolution Steps:
  1. Increase connection pool size
  2. Kill long-running queries
  3. Optimize slow queries
  4. Add connection monitoring
Prevention: Connection pool monitoring, query optimization
Auto-remediation: Available with approval
```
