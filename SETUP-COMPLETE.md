## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Test

```bash

# Test Claude Code is working

./cursor-claude.sh "Test the setup"

# Expected: Claude responds without asking for password
```

### Start Development

```bash

# Get started with implementation

./cursor-claude.sh "Read GPT-Claude-Cursor/10-TASKLIST.md and let's start with Day 1 tasks"

# Claude will guide you through each task
```

### In Cursor IDE

1. **Open Cursor** in ZmartBot project
2. **Open Chat** (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L)
3. **Attach folder**: Type `@GPT-Claude-Cursor` in chat
4. **Paste house rules**:

```bash
Rules for you (Claude):

1. Only create/edit files you list first.
2. Work in small PR-sized steps (≤ 8 files). Always show a diff.
3. Use the GPT-Claude-Cursor docs as the authoritative spec.
4. Never push service keys to the client.
5. After each step, print a brief test plan.
6. If you're not sure, ask before touching unrelated files.

```

5. **Start building**: "Read 00-OVERVIEW.md and tell me what to build first"
