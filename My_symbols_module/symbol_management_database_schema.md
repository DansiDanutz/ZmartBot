This schema integrates seamlessly with existing KuCoin infrastructure while providing the specialized data structures required for dynamic symbol selection, multi-agent evaluation, and real-time portfolio optimization.

The design emphasizes performance, scalability, and data integrity while supporting complex analytical queries and high-frequency data updates. The schema accommodates both operational requirements for real-time trading decisions and analytical needs for historical analysis, backtesting, and continuous system improvement.

## 1. Schema Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Design Principles and Architectural Foundations

The database schema architecture follows a hybrid approach that combines relational integrity with time-series optimization, ensuring both transactional consistency and analytical performance. The design recognizes the dual nature of the Symbol Management Module's requirements, supporting both operational trading decisions that demand immediate data access and analytical processes that require complex historical analysis across multiple dimensions.

The schema implements a layered data architecture where core operational tables maintain current state information with strict consistency requirements, while analytical tables optimize for query performance and historical analysis. This separation enables independent optimization of different access patterns while maintaining referential integrity across the entire system.

Data partitioning strategies are embedded throughout the schema design, utilizing time-based partitioning for high-volume market data and hash-based partitioning for operational tables that require balanced access patterns. The partitioning approach ensures that query performance remains consistent as data volumes grow while enabling efficient data lifecycle management and archival processes.
