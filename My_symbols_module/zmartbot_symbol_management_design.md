Every potential new symbol undergoes rigorous multi-agent scanning to ensure alignment with existing portfolio characteristics and trading strategies.

## 1. System Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Core Functional Requirements

The Symbol Management Module must fulfill several critical functional requirements that form the foundation of its operational capabilities. The primary requirement centers on maintaining a dynamic portfolio of exactly 10 cryptocurrency futures symbols sourced from KuCoin's trading platform. This portfolio represents the universe of tradeable assets for the ZmartBot system, making symbol selection and management a mission-critical function.

The system must implement a sophisticated scoring mechanism that continuously evaluates each symbol's performance potential based on multiple criteria including technical indicators, market sentiment, volume patterns, volatility metrics, and correlation analysis with other portfolio symbols. This scoring system serves as the foundation for all trading decisions, ensuring that no trades are executed unless the symbol meets predetermined strategic thresholds.

Dynamic symbol replacement functionality represents another core requirement, where the two lowest-scoring symbols in the portfolio can be automatically substituted with new opportunities that demonstrate superior potential. This replacement process must be governed by strict validation protocols, including comprehensive multi-agent analysis to ensure new symbols align with existing portfolio characteristics and risk parameters.

The module must integrate seamlessly with a Signal Center that processes incoming trading signals and opportunities. Each new signal must trigger an automated evaluation process that determines whether the associated symbol warrants inclusion in the managed portfolio. This evaluation must consider not only the signal's individual merit but also its impact on overall portfolio composition and risk distribution.

### 1.2 Data Management Requirements

Comprehensive data management capabilities form the backbone of the Symbol Management Module's analytical power. The system must maintain extensive historical and real-time datasets for each managed symbol, including price data across multiple timeframes, volume patterns, order book depth, funding rates, open interest metrics, and social sentiment indicators.

The module must implement dynamic data collection mechanisms that automatically gather relevant information as soon as a symbol enters the Signal Center. This includes technical analysis data, fundamental analysis metrics, news sentiment, social media mentions, whale activity tracking, and correlation matrices with other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments.

Data storage must be optimized for both rapid retrieval and long-term analysis, supporting real-time trading decisions while maintaining historical context for backtesting and strategy refinement. The system must handle high-frequency data updates without compromising performance or introducing latency that could impact trading effectiveness.

### 1.3 Visualization and Interface Requirements
