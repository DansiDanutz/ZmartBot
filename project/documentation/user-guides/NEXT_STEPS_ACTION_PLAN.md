# Cryptometer (Required for market data)
CRYPTOMETER_API_KEY=your_cryptometer_key_here

# KuCoin (For real trading - optional for paper trading)
KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_kucoin_api_key
KUCOIN_SECRET=your_kucoin_secret

```bash
cd backend/zmart-api

# Run with mock data enabled
MOCK_MODE=true python start_paper_trading_test.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Integrations ✅
Once APIs are configured:

```bash
# Test individual components
python test_cryptometer_complete.py
python test_kingfisher_qa_system.py
python test_my_symbols_integration.py

# Run full paper trading
python start_paper_trading_test.py
```

### Step 4: Monitor Performance 📊
```bash
