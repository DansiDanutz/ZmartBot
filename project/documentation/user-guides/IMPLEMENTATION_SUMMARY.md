## 🔒 Security Improvements

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Rate limiting: 5 requests/minute for login
   - JWT token security enhanced
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

2. **API Security**
   - Security headers (XSS, CSRF protection)
   - CORS configuration tightened
   - Input validation with Pydantic

3. **Data Security**
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - Secrets management system ready
   - No hardcoded credentials

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for agent communication
   - Mock fixtures for external APIs
   - Async test support

2. **CI/CD Features**
   - Automated testing on every push
   - Code quality checks
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Coverage reporting

## 📋 Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install slowapi python-jose hvac
   ```

2. **Run initial tests:**
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   ```

3. **Update API keys in `.env.production`**

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
