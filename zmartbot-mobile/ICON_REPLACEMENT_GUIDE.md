# 🎨 EXACT STEPS TO ADD YOUR Z LOGO

## Your Z Logo Implementation

### Current Status:
✅ App configuration updated (dark backgrounds)
✅ Icon paths configured in app.json
⏳ Need to replace actual icon files

### STEP 1: Prepare Your Z Logo
1. **Save the Z logo image** you uploaded
2. **Open in image editor** (Photoshop, GIMP, or online editor like Canva)
3. **Resize to exact dimensions:**
   - Main icon: 1024x1024px
   - Keep the circuit board details visible
   - Ensure golden/bronze colors are vibrant
   - Save as PNG with transparency

### STEP 2: Replace Icon Files
Navigate to: `zmartbot-mobile/assets/images/`

Replace these files with your Z logo:
```
📁 assets/images/
├── icon.png          ← Replace with Z logo (1024x1024)
├── adaptive-icon.png ← Replace with Z logo (1024x1024)
├── splash-icon.png   ← Replace with Z logo (1024x1024)
└── favicon.png       ← Replace with Z logo (48x48)
```

### STEP 3: Test Build
```bash
# After replacing the files:
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Expected Result:
🎯 **App icon will show your golden Z logo with circuit board design**
🎯 **Launch screen will display Z logo on dark background**
🎯 **Android adaptive icon will work with all launcher styles**

## Design Tips for Best Results:
- Ensure the Z is clearly visible at small sizes
- The golden/bronze color will stand out beautifully against the dark theme
- Circuit board details add premium tech feel
- Make sure edges are clean for crisp display

## File Requirements:
- Format: PNG
- Transparency: Yes (recommended)
- Quality: High resolution
- Colors: Your golden/bronze scheme

## Ready to Build?
Once you've replaced the icon files, run:
```bash
./update-icons.sh
```

This will build a new APK with your custom Z logo as the app icon!
