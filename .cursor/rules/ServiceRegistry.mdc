## Description
Core service component of the ZmartBot ecosystem providing essential functionality.

@agent: ServiceRegistryAgent


# Service Registry – Control Plane
Manages dynamic service discovery, unique ports, SAVE/UNDO profiles, and dependency-ordered startup.

## 🚨 **MANDATORY ZMARTBOT SERVICE ARCHITECTURE WORKFLOW**

### **CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES (FORBIDDEN TO IGNORE)**

**🚨 NO EXCUSES - SYSTEM WILL CRASH IF RULES ARE BROKEN**

#### **Rule 1: Service Definition**
- **ANY .py file = SERVICE**: Every Python file represents a service
- **MANDATORY MDC**: Every .py file MUST have an associated MDC file
- **SERVICE COUNTING**: All .py files are counted as services in the system

#### **Rule 2: Port Assignment (Port Manager)**
- **MANDATORY PORT**: Any service trying to connect with other services MUST receive a port from Port Manager
- **PORT DATABASE**: Port Manager assigns a FREE port different from stored ports in database
- **CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If port conflict detected, Port Manager automatically assigns new port
- **PERSISTENCE**: Port assignment is persisted and cannot be changed without proper workflow

#### **Rule 3: Passport Assignment (Integration Gate)**
- **PASSPORT REQUIRED**: Service MUST receive a passport to be integrated into system
- **MDC PREREQUISITE**: Passport is ONLY accepted if the .py service has an associated MDC file
- **UNIQUE IDENTITY**: Each passport provides unique service identity and tracking
- **SYSTEM ACCESS**: Without passport, service cannot access system resources

#### **Rule 4: Registration Process (Final Stage)**
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: Service implementation must be done and tested
- **STRICT WORKFLOW**: Registration follows mandatory steps documented in StopStartCycle and NewService MDC files
- **SUCCESS VERIFICATION**: Only proceed if all steps are successful
- **FINAL STATUS**: Successful registration upgrades service to "REGISTERED" status

#### **Rule 5: Registered Service Requirements**
- **AUTOMATIC STARTUP**: All registered services MUST start when system starts
- **ORCHESTRATION INTEGRATION**: Services must be assigned to Master Orchestration Agent
- **SAFE LEARNING**: Services must integrate with Master Orchestration Agent's safe learning system
- **CERTIFICATION**: All registered services MUST receive a certificate from Certification Service

#### **Rule 6: System Protection**
- **PROTECTION TRIGGER**: After registration completion, Protection Service is automatically triggered
- **DELETION PREVENTION**: Protection Service prevents registered services from being deleted
- **SYSTEM INTEGRITY**: Protection ensures system architecture integrity

### **SERVICE REGISTRY RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **SERVICE REGISTRATION**: Service Registry manages registration of all services
- **PORT UNIQUENESS**: Service Registry enforces unique port assignments
- **PROFILE MANAGEMENT**: Service Registry manages SAVE/UNDO profiles
- **DEPENDENCY ORDERING**: Service Registry manages dependency-ordered startup
- **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: Service Registry enforces the mandatory workflow rules

## Endpoints (on 127.0.0.1:8610)
- GET /services
- GET /services/active
- GET /profiles/current
- GET /profiles/default
- POST /services/register (X-Token if REGISTRY_TOKEN set)
- POST /services/{name}/status
- POST /profiles/save
- POST /profiles/undo

## Contract
- Each service has a unique port (enforced by DB).
- STOP = SAVE: promote TESTED→ACTIVE and snapshot profile.
- UNDO: roll back to the previous profile.
- State snapshots include service configurations and cached data for smooth startup.
- Snapshot creation during STOP operations, loading and transition during START operations.
