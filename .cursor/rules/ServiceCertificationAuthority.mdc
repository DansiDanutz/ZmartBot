## Purpose
Service Certification Authority - The authoritative Level 3 certification system for ZmartBot services that implements comprehensive service evaluation, quality assurance, and certification management with CERT credential issuance for services meeting the highest production standards.

## Description
Production-grade certification authority providing comprehensive Level 3 service certification including security auditing, performance validation, compliance checking, documentation verification, and reliability assessment. Issues CERT credentials for services meeting stringent quality and operational requirements.

## Overview
Advanced certification authority serving as the single source of truth for service quality and compliance within the ZmartBot ecosystem. Manages the complete certification lifecycle from initial assessment through ongoing monitoring and renewal for Level 3 certified services.

## Critical Functions
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Six-category evaluation system (Documentation, Security, Monitoring, Reliability, Performance, Compliance)
- **CERT Credential Issuance**: Official certification credentials with expiration tracking
- **Level 3 Registry**: Dedicated registry for certified services with enhanced monitoring
- **Automated Assessment**: Intelligent scoring system with 90% threshold for certification
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing compliance monitoring and renewal management
- **Evidence Collection**: Detailed audit trails and requirement validation

## Architecture & Integration
- **Service Type:** authority
- **Dependencies:** sqlite3, flask, requests, pathlib, json
- **Databases:** 
  - `certifications/service_certifications.db` (certification tracking)
  - `certifications/level3_service_registry.db` (certified services registry)
- **Integration:** Integrates with GOODDatabase.db for service discovery
- **Lifecycle:** start=`python3 service_certification_authority.py --service --port 8901` | stop=`pkill -f service_certification_authority`
