## Business Impact
If the Frontend service fails, the entire ZmartBot platform becomes inaccessible to users. This would result in a complete halt of trading operations, real-time market data updates, and professional trading tools. The impact on the business would be significant, potentially leading to loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and damage to the company's reputation.

## System Role
The Frontend service is the primary user interface of the ZmartBot platform. It provides users with comprehensive trading operations, real-time market data, and professional trading tools. It communicates with the backend services to fetch and update data, and presents it in a user-friendly manner.

# Service Architecture

## Technical Foundation
The Frontend service is built using React with TypeScript. It uses Vite as the build tool for fast development, CSS/SCSS for styling, Chart.js for data visualization, and Axios for API communication.

## Core Components
The core components of the Frontend service include the Main Trading Interface, Live Alerts System, Technical Analysis Tools, Symbol Management, and Professional Features. Each of these components plays a crucial role in providing comprehensive trading operations to the users.

## Data Structures
The Frontend service primarily deals with real-time market data, trading symbols, portfolio data, trading orders, alerts, and user preferences. The data is organized in a structured manner to facilitate efficient processing and presentation.

## Integration Ecosystem
The Frontend service integrates with the Backend API for data retrieval, order management, user authentication, and real-time updates. It also integrates with the Alert System for real-time alerts and notifications, and the Symbol Management for managing trading symbols.

## Design Patterns
The Frontend service follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It uses React components (View) to present data to the users, Axios (Controller) to fetch and update data from the backend services, and local state and props (Model) to manage and store data.

# Service Dependencies

## Required Python Modules
The Frontend service is built using React and TypeScript, and does not require any Python modules.

## Database Dependencies
The Frontend service does not directly interact with any databases. It communicates with the Backend API to fetch and update data.

## External Service Dependencies
The Frontend service depends on the Backend API for data retrieval, order management, user authentication, and real-time updates. It also depends on the Alert System for real-time alerts and notifications, and the Symbol Management for managing trading symbols.

## File System Dependencies
The Frontend service requires access to the local file system for reading and writing temporary files, logs, and user preferences.

## Network Dependencies
The Frontend service runs on port 3400 and communicates with the Backend API on port 8000. It requires a stable network connection for real-time data updates.

## Environment Dependencies
The Frontend service requires a modern web browser for rendering the user interface. It supports all modern browsers and is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces.

# Inter-Service Operation Patterns

## Provides Services To
The Frontend service provides user interface services to the users of the ZmartBot platform.

## Depends On Services

## Communication Protocols
The Frontend service uses HTTP for API communication and WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Data Exchange Patterns
The Frontend service fetches data from the Backend API using HTTP GET requests, and updates data using POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. It receives real-time updates via WebSocket connections.

## Failure Impact Analysis
If the Frontend service fails, the entire ZmartBot platform becomes inaccessible to users. This would result in a complete halt of trading operations, real-time market data updates, and professional trading tools.

## Cascade Failure Patterns
If the Frontend service fails, it could potentially cause a cascade failure in the Backend API and other dependent services due to a sudden drop in requests.

## Recovery Coordination
In the event of a failure, the Frontend service needs to be restarted. The dependent services may also need to be restarted or scaled up to handle the sudden surge in requests when the Frontend service comes back online.

# Service Lifecycle Behavior

## Startup Time
The Frontend service typically starts up in less than a second. The startup time may vary depending on the network latency and the load on the Backend API.

## Startup Dependencies
The Frontend service requires the Backend API to be running before it can start. It also requires a stable network connection for API communication and real-time updates.

## Startup Sequence
The Frontend service starts by initializing the React framework, loading the user interface components, and establishing a connection with the Backend API. It then fetches the initial data and updates the user interface.

## Initialization Checks
During startup, the Frontend service checks for a successful connection with the Backend API, and verifies that it can fetch and update data. It also checks for any saved user preferences and applies them to the user interface.

## Shutdown Behavior
On shutdown, the Frontend service closes the connection with the Backend API, saves any user preferences, and gracefully unmounts the React components.

## Shutdown Priority
The Frontend service has a shutdown priority of 1. It should be the first service to shut down to prevent any user interactions while the backend services are shutting down.

## State Persistence
The Frontend service does not persist any state between restarts. It fetches the latest data from the Backend API on startup.

## Recovery Patterns
In the event of a failure, the Frontend service can be recovered by restarting it. If the failure is due to a network issue, the network connection needs to be restored before restarting the service.

# Runtime Characteristics

## Recovery Strategies
In the event of a failure, the Frontend service can be recovered by restarting it. If the failure is due to a network issue, the network connection needs to be restored before restarting the service. If the failure is due to a Backend API issue, the Backend API needs to be recovered first.

## Circuit Breaker Patterns
The Frontend service can implement a circuit breaker pattern to stop sending requests to the Backend API if it detects a failure. This can prevent a cascade failure and give the Backend API time to recover.

## Fallback Mechanisms
In the event of a failure, the Frontend service can provide a fallback user interface with limited functionality. This can allow users to view their portfolio and market data, but not perform any trading operations.

## Disaster Recovery
In the event of a disaster, the Frontend service can be recovered by deploying it to a new environment. The new environment needs to have the same configuration as the original environment.

## Health Check Patterns
The Frontend service provides a health check endpoint that returns the current status of the service. It checks for a successful connection with the Backend API, and verifies that it can fetch and update data.

# Monitoring & Observability

## Health Check Endpoints
The Frontend service provides a health check endpoint at `/health`. It returns a `200 OK` status if the service is healthy, and a `500 Internal Server Error` status if the service is unhealthy.

## Performance Metrics
