- **Reporting**: Automated compliance reporting capabilities
- **Record Keeping**: Comprehensive record keeping for all transactions
- **Risk Disclosure**: Clear risk disclosure for all trading activities

## Command & Control Guardrails

### Command Validation
- **Whitelist**: Only approved commands allowed for execution
- **Parameter Validation**: All command parameters MUST be validated
- **Authorization**: Role-based authorization for sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: All commands MUST be logged with user attribution

### Deployment Safety
- **Canary Deployments**: New deployments MUST use canary deployment patterns
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant rollback capability for all deployments
- **Health Validation**: Post-deployment health validation required
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for risky features

### Port Management
- **Port Ranges**: 
  - Frontend: 3400-3499
