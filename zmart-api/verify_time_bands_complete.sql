-- VERIFY TIME BANDS COMPLETE SETUP
-- =================================

-- 1. CHECK DATA STATUS
SELECT
    'üìä TIME BANDS DATA STATUS' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_symbols,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 25 THEN '‚úÖ All 25 symbols loaded!'
        ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è Only ' || COUNT(*) || ' symbols loaded'
    END as status
FROM cryptoverse_risk_time_bands;

-- 2. SHOW ZONE DISTRIBUTION FOR ALL SYMBOLS
SELECT
    symbol,
    current_risk_band as "Current Band",
    ROUND(accumulation_pct, 1) as "Accumulation %",
    ROUND(transition_pct, 1) as "Transition %",
    ROUND(distribution_pct, 1) as "Distribution %",
    CASE
        WHEN current_risk_band LIKE '0.%' THEN 'üü¢'
        WHEN current_risk_band < '0.7' THEN 'üü°'
        ELSE 'üî¥'
    END as "Zone"
FROM v_risk_time_distribution
ORDER BY symbol;

-- 3. INTERESTING STATISTICS
SELECT
    'üìà STATISTICS' as analysis,
    ROUND(AVG(accumulation_pct), 1) as "Avg Accumulation %",
    ROUND(AVG(transition_pct), 1) as "Avg Transition %",
    ROUND(AVG(distribution_pct), 1) as "Avg Distribution %"
FROM v_risk_time_distribution;

-- 4. SYMBOLS BY CURRENT RISK
SELECT
    current_risk_band,
    COUNT(*) as symbols_count,
    string_agg(symbol, ', ' ORDER BY symbol) as symbols
FROM cryptoverse_risk_time_bands
GROUP BY current_risk_band
ORDER BY current_risk_band;

-- 5. COMBINED ANALYSIS - SOL EXAMPLE
SELECT
    'SOL COMPLETE ANALYSIS' as symbol_analysis,
    get_price_at_risk('SOL', 0.715, 'fiat') as "Current Price (at 71.5% risk)",
    (SELECT band_70_80 FROM cryptoverse_risk_time_bands WHERE symbol = 'SOL') as "Days in 70-80% band",
    (SELECT band_70_80_pct FROM cryptoverse_risk_time_bands WHERE symbol = 'SOL') as "% Time in 70-80% band";

-- 6. FINAL STATUS
SELECT
    'üéâ COMPLETE RISK SYSTEM' as status,
    'You now have:' as message
UNION ALL
SELECT
    '‚úÖ' as status,
    '1,025 FIAT risk grid points' as message
UNION ALL
SELECT
    '‚úÖ' as status,
    '410 BTC risk grid points' as message
UNION ALL
SELECT
    '‚úÖ' as status,
    '25 symbols time distribution data' as message
UNION ALL
SELECT
    '‚úÖ' as status,
    'Functions for price/risk interpolation' as message;
