# SIMPLE DATA EXTRACTION GUIDE - IntoTheCryptoverse

## What You Need to Do:

Since we need ALL 41 price points for each symbol's risk (from 0.000 to 1.000), here's the easiest way:

## Step 1: Open IntoTheCryptoverse Risk Page
Go to the page where you can see the risk metrics for different symbols.

## Step 2: For Each Symbol (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
1. Click on the symbol name
2. Look for the risk chart or table
3. You should see a grid/table with:
   - Price levels (USD)
   - Risk values (0.000 to 1.000)

## Step 3: What to Write Down
For each symbol, we need:
- The PRICE at each risk level (0.000, 0.025, 0.050... up to 1.000)
- That's 41 price points per symbol

Example for SOL:
```
SOL Fiat Risk:
Risk 0.000 → Price $10
Risk 0.025 → Price $15
Risk 0.050 → Price $20
...
Risk 0.500 → Price $245 (current)
...
Risk 1.000 → Price $2500
```

## Step 4: Also Get BTC Risk (if available)
Some symbols also have BTC risk. Same thing but prices in BTC:
```
SOL BTC Risk:
Risk 0.000 → Price 0.0001 BTC
Risk 0.025 → Price 0.0002 BTC
...
```

## ALTERNATIVE: Take Screenshots
If typing is too much:
1. Take a screenshot of the FULL risk table for each symbol
2. Save as: BTC_risk_grid.png, ETH_risk_grid.png, SOL_risk_grid.png, etc.
3. I can help extract the data from the screenshots

## What I Need From You:
Either:
- A) The price values at each risk level (I can format them)
- B) Screenshots of the risk grids
- C) Tell me what you see on the page and I'll guide you step by step

Which option works best for you?
