-- See what's already installed
-- ============================================

-- 1. Check which Alert Agent tables exist
SELECT
    'Alert Agent Tables' as module,
    COUNT(*) as tables_found,
    string_agg(table_name, ', ') as existing_tables
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
    'alert_collections',
    'alert_reports',
    'symbol_coverage',
    'manus_extraordinary_reports',
    'mdc_documentation',
    'alert_agent_statistics',
    'prompt_templates',
    'alert_fusion_data'
);

-- 2. Check if tables have data
SELECT
    table_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as columns,
    CASE table_name
        WHEN 'alert_collections' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alert_collections)
        WHEN 'alert_reports' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alert_reports)
        WHEN 'symbol_coverage' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM symbol_coverage)
        WHEN 'prompt_templates' THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prompt_templates)
        ELSE 0
    END as row_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
    'alert_collections', 'alert_reports', 'symbol_coverage',
    'prompt_templates', 'mdc_documentation'
);

-- 3. Check if views exist
SELECT
    'Alert Agent Views' as module,
    COUNT(*) as views_found,
    string_agg(viewname, ', ') as existing_views
FROM pg_views
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND viewname IN (
    'active_alerts_summary',
    'symbol_coverage_status',
    'manus_reports_summary',
    'agent_performance_metrics'
);

-- 4. Check prompt templates
SELECT
    template_name,
    template_type,
    is_active
FROM prompt_templates
LIMIT 5;

-- 5. Final Status
SELECT
    'ðŸ“Š ALERT AGENT STATUS' as report,
    'Alert Agent is ALREADY INSTALLED' as status,
    'Tables and triggers already exist' as finding,
    'You can start using it immediately!' as recommendation;

-- 6. Test Alert Agent functionality
SELECT
    'ðŸš€ READY TO USE' as status,
    'You can now:' as actions,
    '1. Store alerts in alert_collections' as action_1,
    '2. Generate reports in alert_reports' as action_2,
    '3. Track symbols in symbol_coverage' as action_3,
    '4. Use MDC documentation features' as action_4;
