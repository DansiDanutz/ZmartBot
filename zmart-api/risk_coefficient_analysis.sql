-- RISK COEFFICIENT ANALYSIS WITH TIME BANDS
-- ==========================================
-- The coefficients help predict future behavior based on historical time distribution

-- 1. UNDERSTAND THE COEFFICIENT CALCULATION
-- Coefficient = (Band Center √ó Time Percentage) / 100
-- Example: SOL spent 21.96% in 0.5-0.6 band
-- Coefficient = 0.55 √ó 21.96 / 100 = 0.121
