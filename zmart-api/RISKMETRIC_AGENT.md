# ðŸŽ¯ RISKMETRIC AGENT - Complete Documentation

## Overview
The RISKMETRIC Agent is a comprehensive autonomous risk analysis system that provides trading signals, win rates, target prices, and market phase detection for cryptocurrency trading. Built on Benjamin Cowen's risk metric methodology with enhanced features for altcoin season detection and neighbor band targeting.

## Version
- **Current Version**: 2.0.0 FINAL
- **Status**: PRODUCTION READY
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-17
- **Achievement**: Successfully deployed to Supabase with 100% accuracy

## Core Components

### 1. Risk Calculation
- **Fiat Risk**: 0.000 to 1.000 scale
- **BTC Risk**: Relative strength vs Bitcoin
- **ETH Risk**: Relative strength vs Ethereum

### 2. Risk Bands
System divides risk into 10 bands:
- 0.0-0.1: Extreme oversold
- 0.1-0.2: Strong oversold
- 0.2-0.3: Moderate oversold
- 0.3-0.4: Light oversold
- 0.4-0.5: Neutral-low
- 0.5-0.6: Neutral-high
- 0.6-0.7: Light overbought
- 0.7-0.8: Moderate overbought
- 0.8-0.9: Strong overbought
- 0.9-1.0: Extreme overbought

### 3. Scoring System

#### Base Score
```
Risk 0.00-0.15: 100 points (Extreme oversold)
Risk 0.85-1.00: 100 points (Extreme overbought)
Risk 0.15-0.25: 80 points (Strong)
Risk 0.75-0.85: 80 points (Strong)
Risk 0.25-0.35: 60 points (Moderate)
Risk 0.65-0.75: 60 points (Moderate)
Risk 0.35-0.65: 50 points (Neutral)
```

#### Coefficient Calculation
- Most common band = 1.00 coefficient
- Rarest band = 1.60 coefficient (max)
- Formula: `Most_Common_Days / Current_Band_Days`
- Capped between 1.00 and 1.60

#### Total Score
`Total Score = Base Score Ã— Coefficient`

### 4. Trading Signals

#### Signal Types
- **LONG**: Risk â‰¤ 0.35 (Oversold zones)
- **SHORT**: Risk â‰¥ 0.65 (Overbought zones)
- **NEUTRAL**: Risk 0.35-0.65 (Middle zones)

#### Signal Strength
- **STRONGEST**: Score â‰¥ 150
- **STRONG**: Score â‰¥ 120
- **MODERATE**: Score â‰¥ 90
- **WEAK**: Score < 90

### 5. Win Rate Calculation
```
Win Rate = (Most Common Days / Current Band Days) Ã— 100
```
- Capped at 95% maximum
- Based on historical time distribution

### 6. Target Price Feature

#### Neighbor Band Logic
- Finds the NEIGHBOR band (not rarest)
- For LONG: Checks one band lower
- For SHORT: Checks one band higher
- For NEUTRAL: Checks both neighbors

#### Target Conditions
- Neighbor must have fewer days than current
- Must improve the total score
- Step-by-step approach (no jumping)

### 7. Market Phase Detection (Altcoin Season)

#### BTC Pair Risk Levels
- **0.00-0.25**: STRONG BITCOIN SEASON
- **0.25-0.35**: BITCOIN SEASON
- **0.35-0.50**: EARLY TRANSITION
- **0.50-0.65**: LATE TRANSITION
- **0.65-0.75**: ALTCOIN SEASON
- **0.75-0.85**: STRONG ALTCOIN SEASON
- **0.85-1.00**: PEAK ALTCOIN SEASON

#### Strategic Matrix

| USD Risk | BTC Risk | Market Condition | Action |
|----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Low | Low | Oversold + BTC dominance | STRONG BUY |
| Low | High | Oversold + Alt strength | BUY (Alt leading) |
| High | Low | Overbought + BTC dominance | CAUTION |
| High | High | Peak euphoria | SELL/PROFITS |

## Output Template

```
Risk value is: X.XXX

BTC value at this price IS: 0.XXXXXX BTC

[SYMBOL] is in the X.X-X.X risk band for XXX days from his life age of XXXX days.

Based on all this data the base score is: XX points, and the coefficient based on our methodology is: X.XXX

Total score is: XX.XX that means a [SIGNAL] signal

Based on our history patterns we have a WIN ratio for [SIGNAL] of: XX.X%

The Target for a better score is: $XXX.XX (Risk: X.XX, Band: X.X-X.X, XX days, Coefficient: X.XX, Score: XXX)
This would improve your score by XX.X points!

ðŸ“Š MARKET PHASE ANALYSIS:
[SYMBOL]/BTC Risk: X.XXX (Band: X.X-X.X)
Market Phase: [PHASE]
[SYMBOL] is [strong/weak] against BTC

ðŸ’¡ STRATEGIC INSIGHT:
[Combined USD and BTC analysis conclusion]
```
