# Risk Zones & Scoring Logic - CORRECTED

## 📊 Risk Value Zones & Actions

```
Risk Scale: 0.000 ────────────────────────────────────────── 1.000
            OVERSOLD (BUY)          NEUTRAL          OVERBOUGHT (SELL)
```

### 🟢 BUY ZONES (Low Risk = Oversold = Buy Opportunity)
- **0.00-0.15** (Extreme Oversold): 100 base points → STRONGEST BUY signals
- **0.15-0.25** (Strong Oversold): 80 base points → STRONG BUY signals
- **0.25-0.35** (Moderate Oversold): 60 base points → BUY signals

### ⚪ NEUTRAL ZONE
- **0.35-0.65** (Neutral): 50 base points → HOLD signals

### 🔴 SELL ZONES (High Risk = Overbought = Sell Opportunity)
- **0.65-0.75** (Moderate Overbought): 60 base points → SELL signals
- **0.75-0.85** (Strong Overbought): 80 base points → STRONG SELL signals
- **0.85-1.00** (Extreme Overbought): 100 base points → STRONGEST SELL signals

## 🎯 Signal Logic Explained

### Why Low Risk = BUY?
- Risk 0.00-0.15 means the asset is at historically LOW prices (oversold)
- This is a BUY opportunity because price is likely to revert higher
- The lower the risk, the better the buying opportunity

### Why High Risk = SELL?
- Risk 0.85-1.00 means the asset is at historically HIGH prices (overbought)
- This is a SELL opportunity because price is likely to revert lower
- The higher the risk, the better the selling opportunity

## 📈 Scoring Examples

### Example 1: Extreme Oversold (BUY)
```
Symbol: XYZ
Risk: 0.10 (10% - Extreme oversold)
Base Score: 100 points (extreme zone)
Coefficient: 1.50 (rare condition)
Total Score: 150
Signal: LONG
Strength: STRONGEST
Action: 🔥🔥🔥 STRONGEST BUY (0-15%)
```

### Example 2: Extreme Overbought (SELL)
```
Symbol: ABC
Risk: 0.90 (90% - Extreme overbought)
Base Score: 100 points (extreme zone)
Coefficient: 1.55 (very rare)
Total Score: 155
Signal: SHORT
Strength: STRONGEST
Action: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ STRONGEST SELL (85-100%)
```

### Example 3: Neutral (HOLD)
```
Symbol: DEF
Risk: 0.50 (50% - Neutral)
Base Score: 50 points (neutral zone)
Coefficient: 1.00 (common)
Total Score: 50
Signal: NEUTRAL
Strength: WEAK
Action: ⏸️ HOLD (35-65%)
```

## 🔢 Complete Scoring Matrix

| Risk Range | Zone | Base Points | Signal Type | When Coefficient ≥1.5 |
|------------|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 0.00-0.15 | Extreme Oversold | 100 | LONG | STRONGEST BUY (150+ score) |
| 0.15-0.25 | Strong Oversold | 80 | LONG | STRONG BUY (120+ score) |
| 0.25-0.35 | Moderate Oversold | 60 | LONG | BUY (90+ score) |
| 0.35-0.65 | Neutral | 50 | NEUTRAL | HOLD |
| 0.65-0.75 | Moderate Overbought | 60 | SHORT | SELL (90+ score) |
| 0.75-0.85 | Strong Overbought | 80 | SHORT | STRONG SELL (120+ score) |
| 0.85-1.00 | Extreme Overbought | 100 | SHORT | STRONGEST SELL (150+ score) |

## ⚡ Key Points

1. **Extreme zones (0-15% and 85-100%) get the HIGHEST base score (100 points)**
2. **Coefficient multiplies the base score (1.00 to 1.60)**
3. **Total Score = Base Score × Coefficient**
4. **Higher total scores = Stronger signals**
5. **Rarer conditions (higher coefficients) strengthen the signal**

## 🎯 Trading Strategy

### Conservative Approach
- Only trade STRONGEST signals (150+ score)
- Focus on extreme zones with high coefficients
- Wait for risk < 0.15 for buys, > 0.85 for sells

### Moderate Approach
- Trade STRONG signals (120+ score)
- Include strong zones (0.15-0.25 and 0.75-0.85)
- Consider coefficient above 1.30

### Active Approach
- Trade MODERATE signals (90+ score)
- Include all actionable zones
- Any coefficient above 1.00

## ✅ Summary

- **BUY when risk is LOW** (0-35%, especially 0-15%)
- **SELL when risk is HIGH** (65-100%, especially 85-100%)
- **HOLD in the middle** (35-65%)
- **Strongest signals come from extreme zones (0-15% and 85-100%) with high coefficients**
