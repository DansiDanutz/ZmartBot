# üîç EXACT RISK CALCULATION FOR ADA at $0.8824

## Step-by-Step Risk Calculation Using Linear Interpolation

### 1. Current EXACT Price from Binance
- **ADA Price**: $0.8824 USD

### 2. Finding Position in Risk Grid
Looking at the fiat_risk_grid for ADA:

```
{"risk": 0.550, "price": 0.829} <- Lower bound
    ‚Üì
  $0.8824 is here
    ‚Üì
{"risk": 0.575, "price": 0.893} <- Upper bound
```

### 3. Linear Interpolation Formula

```
Risk = Risk_Lower + ((Price - Price_Lower) / (Price_Upper - Price_Lower)) √ó (Risk_Upper - Risk_Lower)
```

### 4. Actual Calculation

**Values:**
- Price = $0.8824
- Price_Lower = $0.829
- Price_Upper = $0.893
- Risk_Lower = 0.550
- Risk_Upper = 0.575

**Calculation:**
```
Risk = 0.550 + ((0.8824 - 0.829) / (0.893 - 0.829)) √ó (0.575 - 0.550)
Risk = 0.550 + (0.0534 / 0.064) √ó 0.025
Risk = 0.550 + 0.834375 √ó 0.025
Risk = 0.550 + 0.02086
Risk = 0.5709
```

### 5. EXACT RISK VALUE
**Risk = 0.571** (rounded to 3 decimals)

## Verification Against Grid Data

The grid shows:
- At $0.829: risk = 0.550
- At $0.893: risk = 0.575
- At $0.8824: risk = **0.571** ‚úì

Our price $0.8824 is 83.4% of the way from $0.829 to $0.893, so:
- Risk is 83.4% of the way from 0.550 to 0.575
- 0.550 + (0.834 √ó 0.025) = 0.571 ‚úì

## Risk Band Determination

Risk 0.571 falls in the **0.5-0.6 band**

Looking at time bands for ADA:
- **0.5-0.6 band**: 639 days (THE MOST COMMON BAND)
- This gives coefficient = 1.00 (worst possible)

## BTC Pair Risk Calculation

ADA/BTC value: 0.00000755 BTC

Looking at btc_risk_grid:
```
{"risk": 0.250, "price_btc": 0.000008} <- ADA is just below this
{"risk": 0.254, "price_btc": 0.000008}
```

Since 0.00000755 < 0.000008, the BTC risk is approximately **0.240**
