-- QUICK CHECK - RUN THIS TO SEE YOUR CURRENT STATUS
-- ============================================

-- 1. WHAT TABLES EXIST?
SELECT
    'TABLES' as category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    string_agg(table_name, ', ') as items
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE 'cryptoverse%';

-- 2. HOW MUCH DATA IS LOADED?
SELECT
    'DATA CHECK' as info,

    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT symbol) FROM cryptoverse_btc_risk_grid) as btc_symbols,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cryptoverse_risk_data) as current_risk_rows;

-- 3. SAMPLE DATA FROM FIAT RISK GRID
SELECT
    'FIAT RISK SAMPLE (BTC)' as info,
    symbol,
    fiat_risk,
    price_usd
FROM cryptoverse_risk_grid
WHERE symbol = 'BTC'
AND fiat_risk IN (0.000, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 1.000)

-- 4. SAMPLE DATA FROM BTC RISK GRID
SELECT

-- 5. CURRENT RISK STATUS
SELECT

-- 6. TEST A FUNCTION
SELECT
