# üéØ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - ZmartBot Service Registry

## üö® CRITICAL: ONE DATABASE TO RULE THEM ALL

**ESTABLISHED**: 2025-08-31  
**STATUS**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND AUTHORITATIVE

---

## üìç **OFFICIAL SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**

### **THE ONE AND ONLY MASTER DATABASE:**
```
/Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot/zmart-api/src/data/service_registry.db
```

**This is the ONLY database that contains authoritative service information. All other databases are either:**
- Backups (safe to keep for recovery)
- Legacy (safe to archive/delete)
- Empty (deleted to prevent confusion)

---

## üìä **MASTER DATABASE CONTENTS**

### **Complete Service Information:**
- ‚úÖ **65 Total Services** across all levels
- ‚úÖ **38 Level 3 Certified Services** with complete certification
- ‚úÖ **61 Services with Passport IDs** assigned
- ‚úÖ **38 Services with CERT IDs** for Level 3 certification
- ‚úÖ **Complete Port Assignments** for all services
- ‚úÖ **Service Status Tracking** and health monitoring

### **Database Schema (Complete):**
```sql
service_registry table contains:
- service_name: Unique service identifier
- passport_id: ZMBT passport assignment
- cert_id: Certification identifier  
- port: Dedicated port assignment
- certification_level: 1=Discovery, 2=Active, 3=Certified
- status: Service operational status
- python_file_path: Source code location
- mdc_file_path: Documentation location
- health_status: Service health monitoring
- process_id: Running process tracking
- start_time: Service startup timestamp
- All other lifecycle and management fields
```

## üóëÔ∏è **ELIMINATED CONFLICTS**

### **Removed Empty/Conflicting Databases:**
- ‚ùå `/zmart-api/service_registry.db` - **DELETED** (empty duplicate)
- ‚ùå `/zmart-api/data/passport_registry.db` - **DELETED** (empty duplicate)

### **Backup Databases (SAFE TO KEEP):**
- ‚úÖ `/database_consolidation/backups/service_registry_MASTER_backup_*.db` - Recovery backups
- ‚úÖ `/database/master_database_registry.db` - Database catalog system

### **Specialized Databases (DIFFERENT PURPOSE):**
- ‚úÖ `/dashboard/MDC-Dashboard/service-discovery/*.db` - Discovery workflow data
- ‚úÖ `/port_registry.db` - Port allocation tracking
- ‚úÖ `/discovery_registry.db` - Service discovery cache

## üîí **ACCESS RULES**

### **WRITE ACCESS:**
- **ONLY authorized services** may write to the master database
- **Level 3 promotion service** - Updates certification levels
- **Passport service** - Assigns passport IDs
- **Service lifecycle manager** - Updates service status
- **Port manager** - Assigns ports

### **READ ACCESS:**
- All services may READ from the master database
- All orchestration agents have READ access
- All monitoring services have read access

### **BACKUP POLICY:**
- Automatic backups before any major operation
- Manual backups during consolidation operations
- Backup retention: 30 days minimum

### **VIOLATION DETECTION:**
- Real-time monitoring for duplicate database creation
- Automated alerts for unauthorized database modifications
- Daily integrity checks of master database
- Compliance verification in all service operations

---

## üìã **SERVICE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **ALL SERVICES MUST:**
1. **Query ONLY the master database** for service information
2. **Update ONLY the master database** for service changes
3. **Never create alternative service registries**
4. **Use provided APIs** for service registry operations

### **CONNECTION STRING:**
```python
MASTER_SERVICE_REGISTRY = "/Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot/zmart-api/src/data/service_registry.db"
```
