**Complexity Reason**: The integration would require careful planning and execution to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend services without disrupting existing functionalities. Additionally, security measures would need to be implemented to protect sensitive data during transmission.

## Potential Challenges
- Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency between the frontend and backend services could be challenging, especially in real-time trading scenarios.
- Security: Protecting sensitive data during transmission between the frontend and backend services would be a major concern.
