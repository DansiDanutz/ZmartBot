> Type: frontend | Version: 1.0.0 | Owner: zmartbot | Port: None

## Purpose
Critical system protection service

## Overview
Auto-discovered service managed by MDC-Dashboard system. This service was identified during automated system scanning and requires manual review and enhancement.

## Critical Functions
- Auto-discovered service functionality (requires manual documentation)
- Service integration with ZmartBot ecosystem

## Architecture & Integration
- **Service Type:** frontend
- **Dependencies:** To be determined
- **Env Vars:** To be determined  
- **Lifecycle:** start=`python3 /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot/zmart-api/services/system_protection_service.py.py` | stop=`pkill -f system_protection_service` | migrate=`n/a`

## API Endpoints
*Endpoints to be documented during manual review*

## Health & Readiness
- Liveness: To be configured
- Readiness: To be configured
- Timeouts: startup_grace=30s, http_timeout=30s

## Observability
- Metrics: To be configured
- Logs: format=python-logging
- Dashboards: To be created



## Service Connections & Dependencies

### Current Active Connections

- **api-keys-manager-service** ‚è≥ **POTENTIAL** - High-potential integration between system_protection_service and api-keys-manager-service - Strong synergy opportunity (Confidence: 100%)

### Priority Connections
*Will be populated automatically during Phase 4 if service qualifies for top 10 priority services*

### Connection Summary
- **Current Active**: 3
- **Potential**: 5  
- **Priority**: 0
- **Total Discovered**: 3
- **Last Discovery Scan**: Auto-updated on system initialization
- **Discovery Method**: Multi-phase automated analysis with diamond pattern extraction
- **Update Policy**: Real-time updates during workflow execution
## Orchestration & Ordering
- Basic Integration: Enabled
- Master Agent Linked: No
- Ordering Hints: To be determined

## Performance & SLO
- Baseline p95 (ms): To be measured
- Notes: Auto-discovered service requiring performance baseline establishment

## Failure Modes & Runbooks
*To be documented during manual review*

## Rollback
- Snapshot required: To be determined
- Playbook: To be determined

## Load Balancing
- Enabled: To be determined
- Pool: To be determined

## Known Issues
- Auto-generated MDC file requiring manual review and enhancement
- Service functionality and dependencies need documentation

## Changelog
- 1.0.0 (2025-08-26): Auto-discovered service, MDC file generated by MDC-Dashboard system
