- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired locks and performance data
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient resource usage with automatic garbage collection
- **Production Logging**: Structured logging with multiple severity levels
- **Safe File Operations**: Atomic file operations with rollback capabilities
- **Performance Reporting**: Detailed metrics including success rates and operation timings

## Architecture & Integration
- **Service Type:** backend
- **Dependencies:** Python 3.9+, threading, hashlib, pathlib, json, datetime, logging, re
- **Env Vars:** PROJECT_ROOT (default: current directory)
- **Lifecycle:** start=`python3 /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot/zmart-api/enhanced_smart_context_optimizer.py --update` | stop=`N/A (stateless)` | migrate=`Context cache and performance metrics migration supported`
- **Enhanced Features:**
  - Thread safety with file-level locking
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 retries, 1s base delay)
  - File integrity verification with MD5 hashing
  - Performance metrics tracking with success/failure rates
  - Resource cleanup with expired lock management
  - Memory optimization with data size limits
- **Schedule Settings:** 3-hour update cycle (optimized from 1 hour)
- **Compression Strategy:** Advanced 3-tier system with key information extraction
