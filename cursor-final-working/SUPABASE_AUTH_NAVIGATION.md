## üéØ What the Setting Looks Like:

The leaked password protection setting might appear as:

- **Toggle switch** labeled:
  - "Check passwords against data breaches"
  - "Enable HaveIBeenPwned integration"
  - "Leaked password protection"
  - "Compromised password detection"

- **Checkbox** with text like:
  - "Prevent users from using compromised passwords"
  - "Enable breach detection"

- **Dropdown** with options:
  - "Password security level: Basic / Enhanced / Maximum"

## üì∏ Can't Find It?

If you still can't find the option:

### Check Your Plan
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Billing**
2. Check your current plan
3. This feature might require:
   - Pro plan or higher
   - Or might be in beta/preview

### Alternative Locations to Check:
1. **Database** ‚Üí **Extensions** ‚Üí Look for "auth" related extensions
2. **SQL Editor** ‚Üí Run: `SELECT * FROM auth.config;`
3. **Edge Functions** ‚Üí Check if password policies are configured there

## üîß Manual Override via SQL:

If the UI option doesn't exist, try this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check current auth configuration
SELECT * FROM auth.config;

-- If the table exists, you might be able to update it
-- (This may not work depending on permissions)
UPDATE auth.config
SET raw_app_meta_data = jsonb_set(
    COALESCE(raw_app_meta_data, '{}'),
    '{password_min_length}',
    '8'
)
WHERE instance_id = (SELECT instance_id FROM auth.config LIMIT 1);
```

1. **Not available on free tier** - Upgrade to Pro
2. **Region-locked** - Not available in your region
3. **Renamed/Moved** - Contact Supabase support
