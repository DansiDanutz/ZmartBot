# EMERGENCY CLEANUP - Fix the Frozen System

## The Problem
There's a persistent background Python process that's blocking all our commands and causing the system to appear frozen.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Open a NEW Terminal Window
Open a completely new terminal window (don't use the current one that's stuck).

### Step 2: Run These Commands in Order

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot

# Kill ALL Python processes (this will stop everything)
sudo pkill -9 python

# Kill any remaining processes on our ports
sudo lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
sudo lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null  
sudo lsof -ti:6379 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
sudo lsof -ti:8086 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Wait 5 seconds
sleep 5

# Verify nothing is running on our ports
echo "Checking ports:"
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :5432
lsof -i :6379
lsof -i :8086
```

### Step 3: If That Doesn't Work, Use Activity Monitor

1. Open **Activity Monitor** (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor)
2. Search for "Python" or "uvicorn"
3. Select any Python processes and click "Force Quit"
4. Do the same for any processes using ports 8000, 5432, 6379, 8086

### Step 4: Restart Your Terminal

1. Close ALL terminal windows
2. Open a fresh terminal
3. Navigate back to the project: `cd /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot`

## Alternative: Complete System Restart

If nothing else works:

1. **Save any work** you have open
2. **Restart your Mac** (Apple menu > Restart)
3. After restart, open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/ZmartBot
   ./cleanup_and_health_check.sh
   ```

## Why This Happened

The issue is likely:
- A background uvicorn server that got stuck
- Multiple Python processes competing for the same ports
- Terminal session that got corrupted

## Prevention

After cleanup, always use:
```bash
# Start server properly
./backend/zmart-api/start_server.sh

# Stop server properly (Ctrl+C)
# Or use: pkill -f "uvicorn src.main:app"
```

## Quick Test After Cleanup

```bash
# Test if system is clean
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :5432
lsof -i :6379
lsof -i :8086

# If all show "No processes", you're good to go!
```

**Status**: Emergency cleanup needed  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - System is frozen  
**Solution**: Force kill all processes and restart fresh
