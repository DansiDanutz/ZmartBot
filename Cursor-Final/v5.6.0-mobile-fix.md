# v5.6.0 Mobile-Responsive Fix Plan

## Current Issues Found
1. ❌ Duplicate step5 ID (Authentication and Google Confirmation both have id="step5")
2. ❌ Inconsistent slide styling across different slides
3. ❌ Not optimized for mobile devices
4. ✅ Order is correct: Info slides (AI, Exchanges, Risk) come before auth

## Fixes Needed

### 1. Fix Step IDs
- Step 5: Authentication → Keep as step5
- Step 6: Google Confirmation → Change duplicate step5 to step6
- Renumber remaining steps accordingly

### 2. Mobile-Responsive Styling
Each slide needs:
- Consistent padding: 20px on mobile
- Responsive grid: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))
- Font sizes: Responsive using clamp()
- Touch-friendly buttons: min-height: 48px
- Viewport meta tag already present ✓

### 3. Consistent Slide Format
All slides should have:
- Logo at top
- Title (h2)
- Subtitle
- Content area
- Navigation buttons at bottom
- Same background style
- Same text colors

## Optimal Slide Order (Current - GOOD!)
1. Welcome (intro)
2. AI Models (show value)
3. Exchanges (show coverage)
4. Risk Management (show features)
5. Authentication (start signup)
6. Google Confirm (conditional)
7. Email Verification
8. Password Reset (conditional)
9. Tier Selection
10. Profile
11. Success

The order is already correct - informational slides come first!
