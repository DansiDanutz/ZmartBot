## LOOP 2: v4.2 Testing
**Time**: 2025-09-27 18:46
**Score**: Still 81%

### Issue Identified:
**⚠️ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ISSUE**
- Our fixes ARE in the git repository
- The HTML file HAS all the fixes locally
- But Netlify is serving an OLD cached version
- Multiple deployment attempts have not updated the live site

### Evidence:
- Local file has: `Forgot Password?`, `termsCheckbox`, `sendWelcomeEmail`
- Live site still has: old code without these fixes
- Git commits confirmed pushed: 9d2c5e7, 475f93d, 03a94ac, d4177d6

---

## Current Status:
**🔄 DEPLOYMENT STUCK AT 81%**

Despite multiple fixes and deployments, Netlify continues to serve the old version.

### What's Working (13/16):
✅ Welcome slide
✅ Get Started button
✅ Email/password inputs
✅ Google OAuth tab
✅ Login link
✅ OTP validation
✅ Resend code
✅ All 3 tiers ($0, $19, $49)
✅ Profile section
✅ Dashboard redirect

### What's NOT Working (3/16):
❌ Password recovery link (fixed locally, not deployed)
❌ Terms checkbox (fixed locally, not deployed)
❌ Welcome email (fixed locally, not deployed)

---

## Next Actions:
1. ⏳ Wait for v4.2.1 deployment to complete
2. 🔍 Check if Netlify has build/cache issues
3. 🔄 Continue testing loop once deployment updates
4. 🎯 Target: 100% score with all features working

---

## Deployment Attempts:
- v4.1: Pushed at 18:31 - Not deployed
- v4.2: Pushed at 18:45 - Partially deployed (title changed but not content)
- v4.2.1: Pushed at 18:47 - Waiting...

**Note**: There appears to be a Netlify deployment/caching issue preventing our fixes from going live.
