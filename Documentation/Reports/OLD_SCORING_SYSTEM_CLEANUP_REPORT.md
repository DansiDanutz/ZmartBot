## 🔄 **FILES UPDATED**

### **1. Scoring Agent (`backend/zmart-api/src/agents/scoring/scoring_agent.py`)**
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed fixed weight constants (30%, 20%, 50%)
- ✅ Eliminated legacy 25-point scale compatibility layer
- ✅ Updated to use 100-point scale throughout
- ✅ Integrated with dynamic scoring system
- ✅ Enhanced ScoringResult dataclass with dynamic weights and market condition
- ✅ Updated signal generation thresholds for 100-point scale
- ✅ Improved status reporting with dynamic agent information

**Before:**
```python
# Legacy fixed weights
self.kingfisher_weight = 0.30  # 30%
self.riskmetric_weight = 0.20  # 20%
self.cryptometer_weight = 0.50  # 50%

# 25-point scale scoring
total_score = score * weight  # Max 25 points
```

**After:**
```python
# Dynamic weighting system
from ...services.integrated_scoring_system import IntegratedScoringSystem
self.integrated_scoring = IntegratedScoringSystem()

# 100-point scale scoring with dynamic weights
dynamic_result = await self.integrated_scoring.dynamic_agent.calculate_dynamic_score(...)
final_score = dynamic_result.final_score  # 0-100 points
```

### **2. Comprehensive Audit Report (`ZMARTBOT_COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025.md`)**
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated scoring system section from "25-Point" to "100-Point Dynamic"
- ✅ Replaced fixed weight descriptions with dynamic weighting features
- ✅ Added market condition awareness and data quality assessment
- ✅ Enhanced scoring excellence criteria

**Before:**
```markdown
### 🎯 25-Point Scoring System
- KingFisher Analysis (30% - 7.5 points)
- RiskMetric Assessment (20% - 5 points)  
- Cryptometer Integration (50% - 12.5 points)
```

**After:**
```markdown
### 🎯 100-Point Dynamic Scoring System
- KingFisher Analysis (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Varies based on market volatility
- RiskMetric Assessment (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Increases during uncertain markets
- Cryptometer Integration (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Favored during trending markets
```

### **3. Platform README (`zmart-platform/README.md`)**
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Updated project description to mention dynamic weighting
- ✅ Replaced 25-point scoring section with 100-point dynamic system
- ✅ Added intelligent weighting features section
- ✅ Included market condition awareness and data quality assessment

**Before:**
```markdown
## 📊 Scoring System
The platform uses a comprehensive 25-point scoring system:
- KingFisher Analysis (7.5 points - 30%)
- Cryptometer API (12.5 points - 50%)
```

**After:**
```markdown
## 📊 Dynamic Scoring System
The platform uses a revolutionary 100-point dynamic scoring system with intelligent weighting:
- KingFisher Analysis (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Increases during high volatility
- RiskMetric Assessment (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Favored during uncertain markets
- Cryptometer API (0-100 points) - Dynamic Weight: Favored during trending markets
```
