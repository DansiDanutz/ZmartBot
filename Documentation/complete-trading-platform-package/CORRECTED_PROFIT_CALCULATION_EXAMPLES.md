# üéØ **CORRECTED PROFIT CALCULATION EXAMPLES**

## **Trade Strategy Module - Position Scaling with Correct Profit Logic**

### **‚ùå PREVIOUS INCORRECT LOGIC**
The previous implementation calculated 75% profit based only on the **initial position value**, which significantly underestimated profit thresholds as positions scaled up.

### **‚úÖ CORRECTED LOGIC** 
The new implementation calculates 75% profit based on the **total invested amount** across all scaling stages, providing accurate profit thresholds that scale with position size.

## üìä **DETAILED CALCULATION EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Complete Position Scaling Scenario**

#### **Initial Setup**
- **Vault Bankroll**: 10,000 USDT
- **Symbol**: BTC/USDT
- **Direction**: Long
- **Entry Price**: 45,000 USDT

#### **Stage 1: Initial Entry**
```
Investment: 100 USDT (1% of bankroll)
Leverage: 20X
Position Value: 100 √ó 20 = 2,000 USDT
Entry Price: 45,000 USDT

Total Invested: 100 USDT
75% Profit Threshold: 100 √ó 0.75 = 75 USDT
First Take Profit Trigger: 100 + 75 = 175 USDT margin
```

#### **Stage 2: First Double-Up** (Better signal score)
```
Additional Investment: 200 USDT (2% of bankroll)
Leverage: 10X
Additional Position Value: 200 √ó 10 = 2,000 USDT
Entry Price: 44,500 USDT (market moved against us)

Total Invested: 100 + 200 = 300 USDT
75% Profit Threshold: 300 √ó 0.75 = 225 USDT
First Take Profit Trigger: 300 + 225 = 525 USDT margin

Total Position Value: 2,000 + 2,000 = 4,000 USDT
Weighted Average Entry: ((45,000 √ó 2,000) + (44,500 √ó 2,000)) / 4,000 = 44,750 USDT
```

#### **Stage 3: Second Double-Up** (Close to liquidation)
```
Additional Investment: 400 USDT (4% of bankroll)
Leverage: 5X
Additional Position Value: 400 √ó 5 = 2,000 USDT
Entry Price: 44,000 USDT (further against us)

Total Invested: 300 + 400 = 700 USDT
75% Profit Threshold: 700 √ó 0.75 = 525 USDT
First Take Profit Trigger: 700 + 525 = 1,225 USDT margin

Total Position Value: 4,000 + 2,000 = 6,000 USDT
Weighted Average Entry: ((44,750 √ó 4,000) + (44,000 √ó 2,000)) / 6,000 = 44,500 USDT
```

#### **Stage 4: Final Double-Up** (Emergency scaling)
```
Additional Investment: 800 USDT (8% of bankroll)
Leverage: 2X
Additional Position Value: 800 √ó 2 = 1,600 USDT
Entry Price: 43,500 USDT (emergency situation)

Total Invested: 700 + 800 = 1,500 USDT
75% Profit Threshold: 1,500 √ó 0.75 = 1,125 USDT
First Take Profit Trigger: 1,500 + 1,125 = 2,625 USDT margin

Total Position Value: 6,000 + 1,600 = 7,600 USDT
Weighted Average Entry: ((44,500 √ó 6,000) + (43,500 √ó 1,600)) / 7,600 = 44,289 USDT
```

#### **Profit Taking Scenario** (Market recovers to 46,000 USDT)
```
Current Price: 46,000 USDT
Price Movement: 46,000 - 44,289 = +1,711 USDT per BTC
Position Size in BTC: 7,600 / 44,289 = 0.1716 BTC
Current Margin: 0.1716 √ó 46,000 = 7,893 USDT
Profit: 7,893 - 1,500 = 6,393 USDT

Since 7,893 > 2,625 (trigger threshold):
‚úÖ FIRST TAKE PROFIT TRIGGERED!

First Take (30%): 7,600 √ó 0.30 = 2,280 USDT position closed
Remaining Position: 7,600 - 2,280 = 5,320 USDT
Trailing Stop Set: 46,000 √ó (1 - 0.30) = 32,200 USDT
```

## üîÑ **COMPARISON: OLD vs NEW LOGIC**

### **‚ùå Old Incorrect Calculation**
```python
# WRONG: Based only on initial investment
initial_investment = 100  # Only first stage
profit_threshold = initial_investment * 0.75  # 75 USDT
take_profit_trigger = initial_investment + profit_threshold  # 175 USDT

# Result: Take profit triggers way too early!
# After all scaling: 1,500 invested, but trigger at only 175 margin
```

### **‚úÖ New Correct Calculation**
```python
# CORRECT: Based on total invested across all stages
total_invested = 100 + 200 + 400 + 800  # 1,500 USDT
profit_threshold = total_invested * 0.75  # 1,125 USDT  
take_profit_trigger = total_invested + profit_threshold  # 2,625 USDT

# Result: Take profit triggers at appropriate level!
# Requires 75% profit on total investment before taking profit
```

## üìà **REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario A: Quick Profit (No Scaling)**
```
Initial: 100 USDT, 20X leverage, Entry: 45,000
Market moves to 46,000 quickly

Total Invested: 100 USDT
Profit Threshold: 75 USDT
Trigger: 175 USDT margin

Current Margin: (46,000 - 45,000) / 45,000 √ó 2,000 + 100 = 144.44 USDT
Status: Not triggered yet (need 175 USDT)
```

### **Scenario B: Scaling Required**
```
Initial: 100 USDT, Entry: 45,000
Market drops to 44,000 (better signal score)
Double up: +200 USDT, 10X leverage

Total Invested: 300 USDT
Profit Threshold: 225 USDT
Trigger: 525 USDT margin

Market recovers to 46,500:
Current Margin: Significant profit due to larger position
Status: Likely to trigger take profit
```

### **Scenario C: Full Scaling Sequence**
```
All 4 stages executed (your example):
Total Invested: 1,500 USDT
Profit Threshold: 1,125 USDT
Trigger: 2,625 USDT margin

This ensures we only take profit when we've made
75% return on our TOTAL investment, not just initial.

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Position Calculation Class**
```python
@dataclass
class PositionCalculation:
    # CORRECTED: Based on total invested
    total_invested: Decimal
    profit_threshold_75pct: Decimal  # 75% of total_invested
    first_take_profit_trigger: Decimal  # total_invested + profit_threshold_75pct
    
    # Position metrics
    total_position_value: Decimal
    current_margin: Decimal
    liquidation_price: Decimal
    
    # Profit taking amounts (based on position value)
    first_take_amount: Decimal      # 30% of position
    second_take_amount: Decimal     # 25% of position
    final_take_amount: Decimal      # 45% of position
```

### **Scaling Configuration**
```python
scaling_stages = [
    PositionScaleConfig(stage=1, bankroll_pct=0.01, leverage=20.0),  # 1%, 20X
    PositionScaleConfig(stage=2, bankroll_pct=0.02, leverage=10.0),  # 2%, 10X  
    PositionScaleConfig(stage=3, bankroll_pct=0.04, leverage=5.0),   # 4%, 5X
    PositionScaleConfig(stage=4, bankroll_pct=0.08, leverage=2.0),   # 8%, 2X
]
```

### **Profit Calculation Method**
```python
async def calculate_position_metrics(self, position, current_price, vault_bankroll):
    # Get all scaling stages
    scales = get_position_scales(position.id)
    
    # CORRECTED: Sum ALL investments
    total_invested = sum(scale.investment_amount for scale in scales)
    
    # CORRECTED: 75% profit on total invested
    profit_threshold_75pct = total_invested * Decimal('0.75')
    
    # CORRECTED: Trigger when margin = invested + 75% profit
    first_take_profit_trigger = total_invested + profit_threshold_75pct
    
    return PositionCalculation(
        total_invested=total_invested,
        profit_threshold_75pct=profit_threshold_75pct,
        first_take_profit_trigger=first_take_profit_trigger,
        # ... other calculations
    )
```

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION EXAMPLES**

### **Test Case 1: Single Stage Position**
```
Input: 100 USDT investment, 20X leverage
Expected: 75 USDT profit threshold, 175 USDT trigger
Actual: ‚úÖ Matches expected

Code Verification:
total_invested = 100
profit_threshold = 100 * 0.75 = 75
trigger = 100 + 75 = 175 ‚úÖ
```

### **Test Case 2: Two Stage Position**
```
Input: 100 + 200 USDT investment
Expected: 225 USDT profit threshold, 525 USDT trigger  
Actual: ‚úÖ Matches expected

Code Verification:
total_invested = 300
profit_threshold = 300 * 0.75 = 225
trigger = 300 + 225 = 525 ‚úÖ
```

### **Test Case 3: Full Scaling (Your Example)**
```
Input: 100 + 200 + 400 + 800 USDT investment
Expected: 1,125 USDT profit threshold, 2,625 USDT trigger
Actual: ‚úÖ Matches expected

Code Verification:
total_invested = 1,500
profit_threshold = 1,500 * 0.75 = 1,125
trigger = 1,500 + 1,125 = 2,625 ‚úÖ
```
