# Screenshot Assets

To enhance the PWA install experience, add screenshots to this directory:

- `desktop.png` (1280x720px) - Desktop view screenshot
- `mobile.png` (750x1334px) - Mobile view screenshot

## Guidelines

1. **Desktop Screenshot**: Show the main onboarding flow or dashboard
2. **Mobile Screenshot**: Show the mobile-optimized view
3. **Content**: Include actual UI, not mockups
4. **Quality**: High resolution, clear text
5. **Format**: PNG for best quality

## How to Capture

1. Open your deployed site
2. Use browser DevTools for mobile screenshot
3. Take full-page screenshots showing key features
4. Crop to exact dimensions
5. Save as PNG

Screenshots are optional but improve the PWA installation prompt on supporting browsers.
