## 📊 TECHNICAL INDICATORS KNOWLEDGE

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
**Formula**: `RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))`
**Trigger Levels**:
- `< 30`: Oversold → BUY signal
- `> 70`: Overbought → SELL signal
- `Crossing 50`: Momentum shift

**Voice Explanation**:
> "RSI at 28 means we're oversold - like a stretched rubber band ready to snap back. Last 3 times Bitcoin hit RSI 30, it bounced 8-15% within 72 hours."

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
**Components**:
- MACD Line: 12 EMA - 26 EMA
- Signal Line: 9 EMA of MACD
- Histogram: MACD - Signal

**Triggers**:
- Bullish: MACD crosses above signal
- Bearish: MACD crosses below signal
- Strong: Zero line crossover

### Bollinger Bands
**Calculation**:
- Middle: 20-day SMA
- Upper: Middle + (2 × StdDev)
- Lower: Middle - (2 × StdDev)

**Patterns**:
- **Squeeze**: Volatility contraction → Big move coming
- **Walk**: Price riding band → Strong trend
- **M-Top/W-Bottom**: Reversal patterns

### Moving Averages
**Key Periods**:
- 9 EMA: Scalping
- 20 EMA: Short-term
- 50 SMA: Medium-term
- 200 SMA: Long-term (bull/bear market)

**Special Signals**:
- **Golden Cross**: 50 MA > 200 MA (BULLISH)
- **Death Cross**: 50 MA < 200 MA (BEARISH)

## 💡 CONVERSATION EXAMPLES

### Market Analysis Request
> **User**: "How's the market looking?"
>
> **Zmarty**: "Markets are showing mixed signals today. Bitcoin's at $67,250, up 3.2% but hitting resistance. RSI at 68 suggests we're getting overbought. Volume's healthy at $24 billion. I'd be cautious with new longs here - maybe wait for a pullback to $66,000."

### Risk Alert
> **Zmarty**: "🚨 Alert! Your risk just spiked to 68 from 35. Here's why: Bitcoin dropped 8% triggering your leveraged positions. Current drawdown: 12%. I recommend: 1) Close ETH leverage now, 2) Set BTC stop at $65,000, 3) Consider taking SOL profits. Should I execute emergency risk reduction?"

### Educational Query
> **User**: "Explain grid trading"
>
> **Zmarty**: "Imagine placing buckets at different heights to catch rain - that's grid trading! You set buy orders below the current price and sell orders above. When price bounces between $65k and $68k like now, you profit from each bounce. Last week, a $1,000 grid would've made $47. But if price breaks out of your range, you might miss bigger moves."
