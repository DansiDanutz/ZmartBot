## 📊 Strategy Deep Dives

### 1. 💰 Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
*"The steady accumulator - perfect for beginners"*

**What it is:**
Buying a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, regardless of price.

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Imagine buying coffee every Monday for $5. Some weeks coffee costs more, some less, but over time you get an average price. That's DCA with crypto!"

**Parameters:**
```javascript
{
  amount: 100,        // $ per interval
  interval: "daily",  // daily/weekly/monthly
  duration: 365,      // days
  asset: "BTC"
}
```

**When to use:**
- Bear markets (accumulation)
- High volatility periods
- Long-term investing
- Reducing timing risk

**Zmarty's recommendations:**
- ✅ BTC/ETH for stability
- ✅ Start with weekly intervals
- ⚠️ Avoid with small altcoins
- 💡 Combine with price triggers

**Voice commands:**
- "Start DCA for Bitcoin"
- "Set up weekly buys of $100"
- "Show my DCA performance"

**Risk management:**
- Max 20% of monthly income
- Stop if down >30%
- Review every quarter

### 2. 🎯 Grid Trading
*"Profit from sideways markets"*

**What it is:**
Placing buy and sell orders at regular price intervals above and below current price.

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Like setting fishing nets at different depths. You catch profits whether the price goes up or down within your range!"

**Grid Setup:**
```javascript
{
  upperPrice: 70000,   // Top of range
  lowerPrice: 60000,   // Bottom of range
  gridLevels: 10,      // Number of grids
  amountPerGrid: 500,  // $ per level
  type: "neutral"      // neutral/long/short
}
```

**Grid Types:**

**Neutral Grid** (Most common)
- Equal buy/sell orders
- Profits from volatility
- Market neutral position

**Long Grid** (Bullish)
- More buy orders
- Accumulates on dips
- Profits on uptrend

**Short Grid** (Bearish)
- More sell orders
- Distributes on pumps
- Profits on downtrend

**Optimal conditions:**
- Price oscillating ±10-20%
- High volume
- No clear trend
- Stable volatility

**Voice setup:**
> You: "Set up a grid for ETH"
>
> Zmarty: "ETH is at $3,600, ranging between $3,400-$3,800 this week. I recommend a neutral grid with 8 levels between $3,350 and $3,850. This needs $2,000 capital. Should I proceed?"

---

### 3. ⚡ Scalping
*"Quick strikes for small profits"*

**What it is:**
Making dozens of trades daily for small profits (0.5-2% per trade).

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Like a hummingbird taking tiny sips of nectar all day. Small profits, but they add up fast!"

**Scalping Rules:**
```javascript
{
  profitTarget: 1,      // % profit target
  stopLoss: 0.5,        // % stop loss
  maxHoldTime: 300,     // seconds
  minVolume: 1000000,   // min 24h volume
  leverage: 1           // 1-3x max
}
```

**Entry signals:**
1. **Order flow imbalance**
2. **Micro support/resistance**
3. **Tape reading patterns**
4. **Level 2 momentum**

**Zmarty's scalping alerts:**
```
"🎯 Scalp opportunity on SOL!
Entry: $142.50 (strong bid support)
Target: $143.57 (+0.75%)
Stop: $142.00 (-0.35%)
Volume spike detected - execute within 30 seconds!"
```

**Requirements:**
- Fast execution (<100ms)
- Low fees (<0.1%)
- High focus
- Strict discipline

---

### 4. 🌊 Swing Trading
*"Ride the waves"*

**What it is:**
Capturing gains from price swings over days to weeks.

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Like surfing - you wait for the right wave, ride it for a good distance, then get off before it crashes."

**Swing Setup:**
```javascript
{
  holdPeriod: "3-10 days",
  targetGain: "10-25%",
  riskReward: "1:3",
  positionSize: "5-10%"
}
```

**Entry criteria:**
- RSI oversold (<30) or overbought (>70)
- Support/resistance test
- Trend line bounce
- Volume confirmation

**Example swing trade:**
```
Monday: BTC bounces off $65,000 support
Zmarty: "Swing trade setup! BTC tested major support 3 times.
        Entry: $65,500
        Target 1: $68,000 (4 days)
        Target 2: $70,000 (7 days)
        Stop: $64,000"

Thursday: BTC at $68,200
Zmarty: "Target 1 hit! Sold 50% for 4% profit. Moving stop to breakeven for remaining position."
```

---

### 5. 🚀 Momentum Trading
*"Follow the strength"*

**What it is:**
Buying assets showing strong upward momentum, selling on weakness.

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Like jumping on a moving train - risky but fast! The trick is knowing when to jump off."

**Momentum Indicators:**
```javascript
{
  relativeStrength: ">80",   // vs market
  volumeIncrease: ">200%",   // vs average
  priceChange24h: ">10%",    // minimum move
  newsImpact: "positive"      // sentiment
}
```

**Entry rules:**
1. Price breaks recent high
2. Volume 2x average
3. RSI between 50-70 (not overbought yet)
4. Positive news catalyst

**Exit rules:**
1. RSI > 80 (overbought)
2. Volume decreasing
3. Failed retest of highs
4. Negative divergence

**Zmarty momentum alert:**
```
"🚀 MOMENTUM ALERT: AVAX
- Up 18% in 6 hours
- Volume 340% above average
- Just broke $45 resistance
- Next resistance at $52
Action: Enter at $45.50, target $51, stop at $43"
```

### 6. 🎯 Mean Reversion
*"What goes up must come down"*

**What it is:**
Trading based on the principle that prices return to their average.

**How Zmarty explains it:**
> "Like a rubber band - the more you stretch it, the harder it snaps back to normal."

**Mean Reversion Setup:**
```javascript
{
  deviation: 2,          // Standard deviations
  lookbackPeriod: 20,    // Days for average
  entryTrigger: "2.5σ",  // Entry at 2.5 std dev
  targetReturn: "mean",  // Return to average
}
```

**Bollinger Band Strategy:**
- Buy when price touches lower band
- Sell when price touches upper band
- Works best in ranging markets

**Example trade:**
```
Zmarty: "MEAN REVERSION on ETH!
Current: $3,200 (2.3σ below 20-day mean)
20-day average: $3,580
Entry: $3,220
Target: $3,550 (mean)
Stop: $3,100 (3σ)"
```

## 📋 Strategy Selection Conversation

### Beginner
> **You:** "What strategy should I use?"
>
> **Zmarty:** "Based on your experience level and $1,000 capital, I recommend starting with DCA. It's like a savings plan - you buy $50 of Bitcoin every week regardless of price. This removes emotion and timing stress. Over 6 months, you'll build a solid position while learning. Want me to set this up?"

### Intermediate
> **You:** "Market seems range-bound"
>
> **Zmarty:** "Perfect for grid trading! BTC has been bouncing between $65k-$68k for two weeks. I can set up a grid with 8 levels that profits from each bounce. Expected return: 2-3% weekly in this volatility. Your $5,000 would generate about $100-150 per week. Should I show you the exact levels?"

### Advanced
> **You:** "I want maximum returns"
>
> **Zmarty:** "With your experience, combine momentum scalping with breakout trades. I'm tracking 3 momentum setups right now with 15%+ potential each. But remember - higher returns mean higher risk. I suggest: 40% momentum trades, 30% scalping, 20% swing positions, 10% reserve. This could yield 30-50% monthly in bull conditions, but prepare for -20% drawdowns. Ready for specific setups?"

## 🎓 Strategy Education Mode

When user asks "Explain [strategy]", Zmarty provides:

1. **Simple analogy** (5 seconds)
2. **How it works** (15 seconds)
3. **When to use** (10 seconds)
4. **Real example** (20 seconds)
5. **Risk warning** (5 seconds)

Example:
> "Explain grid trading"
>
> "Imagine placing buckets at different heights to catch rain - that's grid trading! You set buy orders below the price and sell orders above. When price bounces around, you collect profits at each level. Best in sideways markets like now where BTC can't decide between $65k and $68k. Last week, a $1,000 grid would have made $47. But warning - if price breaks out of your range, you might miss bigger moves!"
