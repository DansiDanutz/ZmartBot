# Privacy Policy Update for Password Security

## Section to Add to Privacy Policy

### Password Security and Breach Protection

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

To ensure the highest level of account security for our users, ZmartyChat implements advanced password protection measures:

#### Compromised Password Detection

We use the **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)** service to check if passwords have been exposed in known data breaches. This helps protect your account from:
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Password spray attempts
- Unauthorized access using compromised credentials

#### How It Works

When you create or update your password:
1. Your password is hashed using SHA-1 encryption on your device
2. Only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to HIBP (k-anonymity protocol)
3. Your actual password never leaves your device
4. The check is performed against a database of over 600 million compromised passwords

#### Privacy Protection

- **Your password is never transmitted** to HIBP or any third party
- We use k-anonymity to ensure your privacy
- The check happens locally in your browser
- No personally identifiable information is shared

#### What This Means for You

- You cannot use passwords that have been found in data breaches
- You'll receive immediate feedback if a password is compromised
- We recommend using a password manager for unique, strong passwords
- Your account security is significantly enhanced

#### Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Understand how we protect your account
- Know what third-party services we integrate with
- Request information about security measures
- Contact us with security concerns

#### Additional Security Measures

Beyond breach protection, we also enforce:
- Minimum password length of 12 characters
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Session management and timeout policies
- Optional two-factor authentication (2FA)

### Data Processing Details

**Third-Party Service:** Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)
- **Purpose:** Password breach verification
- **Data Shared:** First 5 characters of SHA-1 hash only
- **Privacy Method:** k-anonymity protocol
- **Data Retention:** No data is retained by HIBP
- **Service Location:** Global CDN
- **Compliance:** GDPR compliant, privacy-preserving

### User Consent

By using our service, you consent to:
- Password strength validation
- Breach status verification using HIBP
- Enforcement of security policies
- Security notifications when necessary
