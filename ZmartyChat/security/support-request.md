**Subject:** Enable Leaked Password Protection - Project xhskmqsgtdhehzlvtuns

Dear Supabase Support Team,

I need to enable leaked password protection (HaveIBeenPwned integration) for my project, but I cannot find the toggle in my dashboard.

**Project Details:**
- Project ID: xhskmqsgtdhehzlvtuns
- Project Name: ZmartyBrain
- Region: eu-north-1

**Issue:**
- I'm receiving a security warning: "Leaked Password Protection Disabled"
- I cannot find the setting under Authentication → Passwords or Settings → Auth
- I've tried enabling via CLI but it didn't work

**Request:**
Please enable leaked password protection for my project or guide me to the correct location in the dashboard.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards
