# CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WASTED 3 DAYS

## Problem 1: OAuth Not Working
- **Issue:** Clicking Google just moved to next slide without authentication
- **Cause:** Wrong redirect URL - was going to `/` instead of `/auth/callback`
- **Fix:** Changed to `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`

## Problem 2: No Visible Login
- **Issue:** Users can't find where to login
- **Cause:** Login link buried on slide 4
- **Fix:** Added "Already have an account? Sign In" on first slide

## Problem 3: Wrong Slide After Auth
- **Issue:** After login, went to profile instead of tier selection
- **Cause:** goToSlide(7) instead of goToSlide(6)
- **Fix:** All auth paths now go to Slide 6 (tier selection)

## Problem 4: Confusion Between Folders
- **Issue:** Edited ProductionApp, but you were viewing onboarding2
- **Cause:** Running servers on different ports
- **Fix:** Only use ProductionApp folder

## THE ACTUAL WORKING FLOW NOW:

1. **Google/Facebook OAuth:**
   - Click → Authenticate at provider → Return to /auth/callback → Session created → Slide 6

2. **Email Registration:**
   - Register → Verify email → Slide 6

3. **Email Login:**
   - Login → Slide 6

4. **Login Visibility:**
   - First slide has "Already have an account? Sign In"
   - Takes user directly to login form

## TO DEPLOY RIGHT NOW:

Just upload the ProductionApp folder to Netlify. Everything is fixed.
